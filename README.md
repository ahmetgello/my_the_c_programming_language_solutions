# my_the_c_programming_language_solutions
This is my notes, mostly gonna be Exercise solutions from the famous K&amp;R (Kernighan &amp; Ritchie) "The C Programming Language" book.

## [Exercise 1-1](Ex-1-1.c)
When I delete the include stdlib.h library. I get compilation error because 'printf' function is not declared anymore.  
When I delete main(). I get expected identifier or '('. I think identifier is main.  
When I delete first curly bracket '{': I get expected function body after decleration, pretty intuitive. And I get: Extraneous closing brace '}'.  
When I delete printf: the program runs, but don't print anything.  
When I delete the last brace '}' I get: expected '}' to match the first one.
